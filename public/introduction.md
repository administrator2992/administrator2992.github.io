I graduated from a Bachelor's program in Computer Engineering at Universitas AMIKOM Yogyakarta, specializing in Edge Computing, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. I have been collaborating research of my specialization for two years with Prof. In Kee Kim, Ph.D. from the University of Georgia and Prof. Muhammad Santriaji from Universitas Gadjah Mada under the guidance of Prof. Arief Setyanto, S.Si, M.T., Ph.D. After graduating, I have been working for one year in a software and hardware company, Banwibu (盤ウィーブ), located in Jakarta, Indonesia. My highlight work focuses on Edge Computing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Internet of Things, and Automation. Through my experiences, I would like to study, develop, and learn more about my research interests at every opportunity.
